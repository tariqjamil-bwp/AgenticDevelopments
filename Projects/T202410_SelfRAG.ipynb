Optimal delivery conditions, including the choice of adjuvant and schedule of administration, should be established for all forms of personalized neoantigen vaccines. The vaccine design will signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the strength of the immune response to candidate neoantigens.\\n\\nThe manufacture of cancer vaccines is a signiﬁcant challenge. Shared antigen cancer vaccines can be mass-produced as ready-to- use, reducing production times and costs. Since each personalized neoantigen vaccine is treated as a stand-alone drug, demanding for rapid drug production, scalability, and cost control is needed to enable rapid clinical application. This differs from the conventional pharmaceutical development approach, focusing on bulk upscaling. Therefore, adopting a synthetic vaccine technology that facilitates robust, fast and cost-effective production through a simple, invariant, and good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compliant process is essential to address these complexities. Favorable solutions may involve completely digitizing the production pro- cesses, platforming the production quality control, modularizing production plants, and intelligentizing production hardware.231 There is a need for better coordination of every aspect of production and preparation, automated management tracking of every step, and acceleration of the entire vaccine preparation. These advance- ments have enabled the creation of scaled parallelized miniaturized production lines and signiﬁcantly enhanced the overall efﬁciency and accessibility of cancer vaccines for clinical applications.', 'lysates.67,227 TCR sequencing of\\n\\ntumor\\n\\ninto the diversity and clonality of\\n\\nthe clonotypic level\\n\\nEpitope spreading refers to releasing additional epitopes after cancer cell destruction using cancer vaccines, thereby diversifying the T cell repertoire and eliciting a broader T cell immune response.

This therapeutic intervention targets prostate acid phosphatase, a TAA that exhibits high expression levels in prostate cancer cells.20,21 Additionally, a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine comprising four TAAs has demonstrated the capacity to elicit robust and durable immune responses directed against these antigens, with or without in patients with unresectable melanoma.22 A lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based cancer vaccine encoding the four most frequent Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS) mutation antigens (G12D, G12V, G13D, and G12C) is able to elicit both cytotoxic and memory T cell phenotypes targeting KRAS- mutated tumor cells.

Five elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia were treated with WT1 recombinant protein in a phase 1/2 clinical trial (NCT01051063) and the majority of the patients achieved above- average response durations.24 MAGE family proteins are the most widely used immunogenic cancer-testis antigens with hetero- geneous expression in tumor cells and poor understanding.16,25 A large-scale MAGE-A3 immunotherapy-focused phase 3 trial as an adjuvant therapy was conducted, however, the vaccine didn’t improve the clinical beneﬁts of the patients with resected stage III melanoma, leading to its discontinuation.26 In a phase 3 trial, the MAGE-A3 protein vaccine was terminated because of its limited immunogenicity in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).27 Notably, it may be due to cross-reactivity with many MAGE-A isoforms. Therefore, a MAGE-A DNA vaccine consensus sequence was formulated to address this issue, which elicited a robust immune response, signiﬁcantly leading to a substantial reduction in tumor growth in mice.28 Mucin 1 glycoprotein is widely distributed and abnormally glycosylated on cancer cells’ surfaces. Tecemotide, a peptide vaccine used against mucin 1, extended the overall survival in patients with advanced NCSLC who were concurrently undergoing chemoradiother- apy.29,30 Additionally, high expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/neu (HER2/neu) makes some breast cancers highly malignant.31 The peptide vaccine Nelipepimut-S was safe in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer; however, no therapeu- tic effect was observed when compared to the placebo group.32 Nevertheless, the use of Nelipepimut-S plus trastuzumab resulted in speciﬁc and durable immune responses in patients with triple- negative breast cancer and resulted in a signiﬁcant clinical beneﬁt to the patients.33 A plasmid DNA vaccination encoding the HER2/ neu intracellular domain was shown in a recent phase 1 clinical study to induce the production of antigen-speciﬁc type 1 T cells in a majority of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.15\\n\\nICI,\\n\\npatients\\n\\nwith\\n\\nadvanced tumor 1 (WT1)\\n\\nKRAS-mutated\\n\\n(OS)\\n\\ntargeting shared Viral antigen.
