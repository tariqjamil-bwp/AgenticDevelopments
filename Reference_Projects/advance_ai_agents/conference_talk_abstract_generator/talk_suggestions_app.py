Your mission is to create a compelling, unique, and timely talk proposal.

**User's Core Idea:** "{query}"

To assist you, here is a two-part analysis:

---
**PART 1: HISTORICAL CONTEXT (FROM OUR DATABASE)**
These are similar talks that have been given in the past. Your proposal MUST offer a fresh perspective or build upon these in a novel way. Do not simply repeat these topics.

{historical_context}
---
**PART 2: REAL-TIME WEB ANALYSIS (FROM OUR RESEARCH AGENT)**
This is a fresh analysis of what's currently happening on the web regarding this topic (latest discussions, emerging tech, community sentiment). This provides the "zeitgeist" and reveals current gaps.

{adk_research}
---

**YOUR TASK:**
Synthesize the information from ALL parts above (user idea, historical context, and real-time analysis). Create a complete talk proposal that is timely, avoids repetition, and addresses a genuine gap or novel angle.

**REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:**

**Title:**
*A compelling, modern title that captures the essence of your unique angle.*

**Abstract:**
*A detailed 2-3 paragraph summary. It should briefly acknowledge the existing landscape and then clearly explain what new insights, techniques, or case studies this talk will present.
   1. Focuses on end-user/consumer perspective
#         2. Builds upon existing concepts rather than repeating them
#         3. Follows a similar structure to successful talks
#         4. Addresses current trends and gaps in the topic area*

**Key Learning Objectives:**
*Provide 3-4 bullet points of what an attendee will learn.*

**Target Audience:**
*Specify the ideal audience (e.g., Beginner DevOps Engineers, Expert SREs, Platform Architects).*

**Why This Talk is Unique:**
*A crucial section explaining precisely how this talk differs from past talks and aligns with the current trends identified in the real-time analysis.*
