"""
Running an advanced Google ADK multi-agent system for professional blog writing.

This script orchestrates a three-step content creation pipeline. It uses a more
narrative and professional prompting style, moving away from the rigid
'Role/Goal' format, while retaining full functionality, including web search for
sources and image search for embedding visuals.

The workflow consists of three specialized agents:
1.  **Content Planner**: Creating a detailed outline and finding source URLs.
2.  **Content Writer**: Writing the article, embedding images and sources.
3.  **Editor**: Reviewing and refining the final blog post for quality.
