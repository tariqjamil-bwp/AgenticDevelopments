# AI Fitness Coach: Customizing Fitness Routines with LLMs

This project implements an AI-powered Fitness Coach that creates personalized fitness plans using Large Language Models (LLMs). It leverages the LangChain and LangGraph frameworks to create a multi-agent system that interacts with users, generates fitness plans, and provides ongoing support and motivation.

## Features

- User profile creation based on input data
- Personalized fitness plan generation
- Feedback collection and plan adjustment
- Progress monitoring
- Motivational support
- Interactive Gradio UI for easy user interaction

## Caution

**Important Note:** While this AI Fitness Coach aims to provide personalized fitness advice, it should not be considered a substitute for professional medical or fitness expertise. The generated plans are based on general fitness principles and may not account for all individual health conditions or circumstances. Always consult with a healthcare professional or certified fitness trainer before starting any new exercise regimen, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions or injuries.
