Google ADK Conversion of a CrewAI Customer Support Multi-Agent System.

This script demonstrates how to convert a CrewAI workflow into the Google
Agent Development Kit (ADK) framework.

Original CrewAI concepts are mapped to ADK components:
- CrewAI Agent -> ADK LlmAgent
- CrewAI Task -> Integrated into the LlmAgent's instructions
- CrewAI Tool -> Wrapped in an async function and passed to an ADK FunctionTool
- CrewAI Crew -> ADK SequentialAgent
- CrewAI Memory -> Handled by the ADK SessionService
