        "# Solving Multiple Tasks in a Sequence of Chats\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook showcases how to use the new chat interface of conversational agents in AutoGen: initiate_chats, to conduct a series of tasks. This new interface allows one to pass multiple tasks and their corresponding dedicated agents. Once initiate_chats is invoked, the tasks will be solved sequentially, with the summaries from previous tasks provided to subsequent tasks as context, if the `summary_method` argument is specified.\n",

This impressive climb can be largely attributed to the company's groundbreaking strides in AI technologies. NVIDIA's innovation engine is firing on all cylinders, with recent partnerships underscoring its pivotal role in the tech ecosystem. The surge has propelled them to new heights, overtaking giants like Amazon in market value. Investors seem to be betting heavily on NVIDIA's future, recognizing it as a beacon of the AI revolution.\n",

The electric vehicle pioneer, helmed by the enigmatic Elon Musk, seems to be navigating through choppy waters. Questions swirl around the company: Is the investor sentiment shifting? Are the winds of competition blowing fiercer? Or are the recent squalls caused by Elon Musk's ventures into the equally volatile Twitter sphere influencing Tesla's valuations? These factors, along with apprehensions about financial performance, have cast shadows on Tesla's stock market presence. However, true to Tesla’s spirit, many investors maintain a \"weather-the-storm\" stance, convinced that the company is capable of steering back to stronger currents.\n",

            "Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) depicts a steadier voyage, charting a course with a 6.40% increase in stock prices, which now stand at $415.26. This moderate but stable growth could be seen as the hallmark of Microsoft's enduring legacy in the technology sector. Microsoft's cloud computing services continue to be a powerhouse, generating a robust performance that suggests reliability amidst market fluctuations. Its diverse product and services portfolio has historically offered investors a sense of security — and this past month has been no exception. Microsoft's steady sail is a testament to its strategic positioning and resilient operations, a lighthouse for investors navigating the rough seas of the tech industry.\n",

NVIDIA's significant growth highlights the market's hunger for cutting-edge AI advancements and the company's capability to deliver them. Tesla's recent headwinds are a reminder that even the most disruptive companies are not immune to external factors and sentiment shifts, while Microsoft's steady performance reassures us that longstanding pillars of tech can offer safe harbor in turbulent times.\n",

            "Investing in tech requires a measured approach, with an appreciation for the dynamics at play - innovation, public perception, and economic trends — each capable of steering these giants in unexpected directions. As always, the market keeps a watchful eye on these companies, looking for signs and signals of what may come, like seasoned sailors reading the stars and the swell. It's this constant interplay of forces that makes tech stocks a thrilling, albeit complex, adventure in the world of investments.\n",
