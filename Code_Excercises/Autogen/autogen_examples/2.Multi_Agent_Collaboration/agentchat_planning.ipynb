        "AutoGen offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool, or human, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent conversation.\n",

We further create a planning agent for the assistant agent to consult. The planning agent is a variation of the LLM-based `AssistantAgent` with a different system message.\n",
