    "# Auto Generated Agent Chat: Solving Tasks Requiring Web Info\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool, or human, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent conversation.\n",
    "Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent` to perform tasks which require acquiring info from the web:\n",
    "* discuss a paper based on its URL.\n",
    "* discuss about the stock market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here `AssistantAgent` is an LLM-based agent that can write Python code (in a Python coding block) for a user to execute for a given task. `UserProxyAgent` is an agent which serves as a proxy for a user to execute the code written by `AssistantAgent`. By setting `human_input_mode` properly, the `UserProxyAgent` can also prompt the user for feedback to `AssistantAgent`. For example, when `human_input_mode` is set to \"TERMINATE\", the `UserProxyAgent` will execute the code written by `AssistantAgent` directly and return the execution results (success or failure and corresponding outputs) to `AssistantAgent`, and prompt the user for feedback when the task is finished. When user feedback is provided, the `UserProxyAgent` will directly pass the feedback to `AssistantAgent`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen requires `Python>=3.8`. To run this notebook example, please install pyautogen and docker:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pyautogen docker\n",

      "Abstract: Abstract:AutoGen is an open-source framework that allows developers to build LLM applications via multiple agents that can converse with each other to accomplish tasks. AutoGen agents are customizable, conversable, and can operate in various modes that employ combinations of LLMs, human inputs, and tools. Using AutoGen, developers can also flexibly define agent interaction behaviors. Both natural language and computer code can be used to program flexible conversation patterns for different applications. AutoGen serves as a generic infrastructure to build diverse applications of various complexities and LLM capacities. Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in many example applications, with domains ranging from mathematics, coding, question answering, operations research, online decision-making, entertainment, etc.\n",

AutoGen agents are customizable, conversable, and can operate in various modes that employ combinations of LLMs, human inputs, and tools. Using AutoGen, developers can also flexibly define agent interaction behaviors. Both natural language and computer code can be used to program flexible conversation patterns for different applications. AutoGen serves as a generic infrastructure to build diverse applications of various complexities and LLM capacities. Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in many example applications, with domains ranging from mathematics, coding, question answering, operations research, online decision-making, entertainment, etc.\\nKeywords: []\\n', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'user_proxy'}, {'content': 'The code has successfully executed and fetched the title, abstract, and keywords of the paper.\\n\\nBased on the output, it appears that the paper \"AutoGen: Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Conversation\" is related to natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.
