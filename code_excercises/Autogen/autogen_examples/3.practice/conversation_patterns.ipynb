        "# Conversation Patterns\n",

        "In the previous chapter we used two-agent conversation, which\n",
        "can be started by the `initiate_chat` method.\n",
        "Two-agent chat is a useful conversation pattern but AutoGen offers more.\n",
        "In this chapter, we will first dig a little bit more into the two-agent\n",
        "chat pattern and chat result,\n",
        "then we will show you several conversation patterns that involve\n",

        "### An Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Two-agent chat**: the simplest form of conversation pattern where two agents chat with each other.\n",
        "2. **Sequential chat**: a sequence of chats between two agents, chained together by a carryover mechanism, which brings the summary of the previous chat to the context of the next chat.\n",
        "3. **Group Chat**: a single chat involving more than two agents. An important question in group chat is: What agent should be next to speak? To support different scenarios, we provide different ways to organize agents in a group chat:\n",
        "    - We support several strategies to select the next agent: `round_robin`, `random`, `manual` (human selection), and `auto` (Default, using an LLM to decide).\n",
        "    - We provide a way to constrain the selection of the next speaker (See examples below).\n",
        "    - We allow you to pass in a function to customize the selection of the next speaker. With this feature, you can build a **StateFlow** model which allows a deterministic workflow among your agents.\n",
        " Please refer to this [guide](/docs/topics/groupchat/customized_speaker_selection) and this [blog post](/blog/2024/02/29/StateFlow) on StateFlow for more details.\n",
        "4. **Nested Chat**: package a workflow into a single agent for reuse in a larger workflow."
