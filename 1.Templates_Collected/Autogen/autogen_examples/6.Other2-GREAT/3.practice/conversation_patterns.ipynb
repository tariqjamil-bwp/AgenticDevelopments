        "In the previous chapter we used two-agent conversation, which\n",
        "can be started by the `initiate_chat` method.\n",
        "Two-agent chat is a useful conversation pattern but AutoGen offers more.\n",
        "In this chapter, we will first dig a little bit more into the two-agent\n",
        "chat pattern and chat result,\n",
        "then we will show you several conversation patterns that involve\n",

        "### An Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Two-agent chat**: the simplest form of conversation pattern where two agents chat with each other.\n",
        "2. **Sequential chat**: a sequence of chats between two agents, chained together by a carryover mechanism, which brings the summary of the previous chat to the context of the next chat.\n",
        "3. **Group Chat**: a single chat involving more than two agents. An important question in group chat is: What agent should be next to speak? To support different scenarios, we provide different ways to organize agents in a group chat:\n",
        "    - We support several strategies to select the next agent: `round_robin`, `random`, `manual` (human selection), and `auto` (Default, using an LLM to decide).\n",
        "    - We provide a way to constrain the selection of the next speaker (See examples below).\n",
        "    - We allow you to pass in a function to customize the selection of the next speaker. With this feature, you can build a **StateFlow** model which allows a deterministic workflow among your agents.\n",
        " Please refer to this [guide](/docs/topics/groupchat/customized_speaker_selection) and this [blog post](/blog/2024/02/29/StateFlow) on StateFlow for more details.\n",
        "4. **Nested Chat**: package a workflow into a single agent for reuse in a larger workflow."

            "\n",
            "This intuition is the foundation of the triangle inequality. The inequality ensures that the distance between two points (A and C) is always less than or equal to the sum of the distances between the intermediate points (A to B and B to C). This property helps maintain the coherence and logic of our geometric and spatial understanding.\n",

            "**Real-world scenarios where the triangle inequality is crucial:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **GPS Navigation:** In GPS calculations, the triangle inequality is essential for providing accurate distances and routes between locations. If the inequality were not considered, GPS systems might suggest routes that are longer than necessary or even impossible to traverse.\n",
            "2. **Flight Route Planning:** When planning flight routes, the triangle inequality helps optimize flight paths by ensuring that the total distance flown is minimized. This leads to fuel efficiency, reduced emissions, and cost savings.\n",
            "3. **Robotics and Computer Vision:** In robotics and computer vision, the triangle inequality is used to calculate distances and positions of objects in 2D and 3D spaces. This is critical for tasks like object recognition, tracking, and manipulation.\n",
            "4. **Surveying and Mapping:** Surveyors and cartographers rely on the triangle inequality to ensure that their measurements and maps are accurate. This is particularly important for applications like construction, urban planning, and natural resource management.\n",
            "5. **Medical Imaging:** In medical imaging techniques like MRI and CT scans, the triangle inequality is used to reconstruct images and calculate distances within the body. This helps doctors diagnose and treat medical conditions more effectively.\n",
            "6. **Architecture and Construction:** When designing buildings and infrastructure, architects and engineers use the triangle inequality to ensure that their designs are feasible and efficient. This helps minimize construction costs, reduce materials waste, and optimize building performance.\n",
            "\n",
            "In each of these scenarios, neglecting the triangle inequality could lead to significant errors, inefficiencies, or even safety hazards. It's a fundamental concept that has far-reaching implications in many fields!\n",
