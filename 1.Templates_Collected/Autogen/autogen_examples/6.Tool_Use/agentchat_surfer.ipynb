      "AutoGen is a framework that enables development of LLM applications using multiple agents that can converse with each other to solve tasks. AutoGen agents are customizable, conversable, and seamlessly allow human participation. They can operate in various modes that employ combinations of LLMs, human inputs, and tools.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "### Main Features[​](#main-features \"Direct link to heading\")\n",
      "\n",
      "* AutoGen enables building next-gen LLM applications based on [multi-agent conversations](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat) with minimal effort. It simplifies the orchestration, automation, and optimization of a complex LLM workflow. It maximizes the performance of LLM models and overcomes their weaknesses.\n",
      "* It supports [diverse conversation patterns](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat#supporting-diverse-conversation-patterns) for complex workflows. With customizable and conversable agents, developers can use AutoGen to build a wide range of conversation patterns concerning conversation autonomy,\n",
      "the number of agents, and agent conversation topology.\n",
      "* It provides a collection of working systems with different complexities. These systems span a [wide range of applications](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat#diverse-applications-implemented-with-autogen) from various domains and complexities. This demonstrates how AutoGen can easily support diverse conversation patterns.\n",
      "* AutoGen provides [enhanced LLM inference](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/enhanced_inference#api-unification). It offers utilities like API unification and caching, and advanced usage patterns, such as error handling, multi-config inference, context programming, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "AutoGen is powered by collaborative [research studies](/autogen/docs/Research) from Microsoft, Penn State University, and University of Washington.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Quickstart[​](#quickstart \"Direct link to heading\")\n",
      "\n",
      "Install from pip: `pip install pyautogen`. Find more options in [Installation](/autogen/docs/Installation).\n",
      "For [code execution](/autogen/docs/FAQ#code-execution), we strongly recommend installing the python docker package, and using docker.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Multi-Agent Conversation Framework[​](#multi-agent-conversation-framework \"Direct link to heading\")\n",
      "\n",
      "Autogen enables the next-gen LLM applications with a generic multi-agent conversation framework. It offers customizable and conversable agents which integrate LLMs, tools, and humans.\n",
      "By automating chat among multiple capable agents, one can easily make them collectively perform tasks autonomously or with human feedback, including tasks that require using tools via code. For [example](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/test/twoagent.py),\n",
