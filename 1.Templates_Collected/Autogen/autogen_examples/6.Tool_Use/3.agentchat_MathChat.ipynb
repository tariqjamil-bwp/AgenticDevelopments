    "# Auto Generated Agent Chat: Using MathChat to Solve Math Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool or human, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent conversation. Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).\n",
    "\n",
    "MathChat is an experimental conversational framework for math problem solving. In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use MathChat to solve math problems. MathChat uses the `AssistantAgent` and `MathUserProxyAgent`, which is similar to the usage of `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent` in other notebooks (e.g., [Automated Task Solving with Code Generation, Execution & Debugging](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_auto_feedback_from_code_execution.ipynb)). Essentially, `MathUserProxyAgent` implements a different auto reply mechanism corresponding to the MathChat prompts. You can find more details in the paper [An Empirical Study on Challenging Math Problem Solving with GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01337) or the [blogpost](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/06/28/MathChat).\n",

    "    1. `'python'` is a simplified prompt from the default prompt that uses Python only. \n",
    "    2. `'two_tools'` further allows the selection of Python or Wolfram Alpha based on this simplified `python` prompt. Note that this option requires a Wolfram Alpha API key and put it in `wolfram.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can also input your customized prompt if needed.\n",
    "Since this mathproxyagent detects '\\boxed{}' as termination, you need to have a similar termination sentence in the prompt: \"If you get the answer, put the answer in \\\\boxed{}.\". If the customized is provided, the `prompt_type` will be ignored.\n",
