            "\n",
            "**Improvements:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Error Handling:** Currently, the code assumes that the `arxiv.query()` function will always return results. However, this may not always be the case, especially if there are issues with the network connection or the query itself. Consider adding error handling code to handle such situations.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Abstract Length Limitation:** You're currently limiting the abstract length to 200 characters using `abstract[:200]`. This can result in truncated abstracts that might not convey the full meaning. You might want to consider increasing the character limit or even better, dynamically adjusting the limit based on the available space in the markdown table.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Debugging Statements:** It's always helpful to have print statements in place for debugging purposes. You can use a library like `logging` to log debug information. This way, you can easily toggle on or off the debug information based on your needs.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Flexibility in Domain Mapping:** The current domain mapping is hardcoded. Consider making it more flexible by allowing the domain mapping to be externalized. This will make it easier to update the domain mapping in the future.\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **Creation of Empty DataFrame:** When creating a DataFrame from empty lists, pandas will raise an error if the DataFrame has no columns or rows. Be sure to handle this scenario in your code.\n",

            "**Example Code Changes:**\n",
