# From LLMs to Stateful Long Running Multi-Agent Systems

This document has been split into three separate set of articles, each tackling a unique question:

1. What are AI agents, and what features and functionalities can we anticipate they’ll have? What should be the Guiding Principles for Crafting Agentic AI?
2. What Architecture to use to for Multi-Agent Systems (AgentiaCloud)?
3. What technological components and infrastructure are needed to build and implement these Multi-Agent Systems (AgentiaCloud)? We will discuss in detail our AgentiaCloud technology stack.

Note: These questions are answered in topics 01, 02, and 03 in this directory.

## Agentic AI Development and Use Cases

In 2025, Agentic AI emerges as a global focal point. Leading tech giants such as OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, AWS, Oracle, DeepSeek, Anthropic, Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei, ByteDance, and others are driving this trend.

Insha Allah, we aim to revolutionize Pakistan and the world through Agentic AI, with an emphasis on creating specialized Vertical Agentic solutions.

We have developed detailed documentation outlining Multi-Agent Systems, including their architecture, which will enable us to build AI Agents on a global scale. Most notably, it highlights the key vertical sectors that our thousands of students will initially target:

Here’s a comprehensive list of all the agents we’ve explored, spanning various domains and showcasing the application of **event-driven architecture (EDA)**, **three-tier architecture**, **stateless computing**, **scheduled computing (CronJobs)**, **human-in-the-loop (HITL)**, and, in some cases, **LLM intelligence**.
