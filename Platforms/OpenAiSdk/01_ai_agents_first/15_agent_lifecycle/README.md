# Agents LifeCycle

The lifecycle of an agent refers to the complete sequence of stages an agent goes through from the moment it's activated until it completes its task. 

This focuses on the individual agent. It lets you inject custom logic right into the agent's specific workflow—tracking events such as when an agent starts processing, when it completes its task, and when it interacts with external tools.

In OpenAI Agents SDK, this lifecycle is managed through **AgentHooks**, which let you inject custom logic at various key points during an agent's execution. Here’s a breakdown of the typical stages:

- **Initialization/Activation:**  
  When an agent is created and activated, the `on_start` hook is triggered. This is where any setup or initial logging can take place.

- **Execution/Processing:**  
  As the agent processes its task, it may invoke tools or perform specific actions. Hooks like `on_tool_start` and `on_tool_end` allow you to monitor or modify behavior during these interactions.

- **Handoff (if applicable):**  
  If the agent transfers control to another agent (or vice versa), the `on_handoff` hook is called. This helps track transitions between different agents in a multi-agent setup.

- **Completion/Termination:**  
  When the agent finishes its task and produces an output, the `on_end` hook is executed. This stage is often used to finalize logs, perform cleanup, or trigger post-processing actions.

Overall, the lifecycle provides a structured framework to observe and interact with an agent's behavior at every critical phase of its operation.
