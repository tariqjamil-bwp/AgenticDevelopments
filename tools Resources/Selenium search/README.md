# LangChain Tools
A collection of tools for LangChain that I have coded.

## Selenium Search
A basic search tool that uses DuckDuckGo search directly in a browser as a tool, if you include this in your [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) Agent's toolbox, you will see that when it needs to search, it will open up a selenium browser, perform a search and then close the browser.
I used this with the Leonardo DiCaprio's Girlfriend example
